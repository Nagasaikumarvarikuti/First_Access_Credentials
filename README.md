# Azure Logic App: First_Access_Credential  

## 🎯 **Purpose**  
- 🚀 Triggered by an incident in Microsoft Sentinel.  
- 🌐 Retrieves related IP addresses from the incident.  
- 🏠 Checks if the IP is private or public.  
- 🔍 If public, performs a VirusTotal lookup to check reputation.  
- 🛡️ Categorizes IP addresses as **Malicious** or **Clean** based on the reputation.  
- 🧑‍💻 **Validates sign-in activity** using Azure Monitor logs to check the authentication type and trust type.  
- 🔎 **Retrieves user audit logs** to confirm operations related to credential changes.  
- 📝 Logs the results in Microsoft Sentinel as a comment.

## 📝 **Description**  
The **First_Access_Credential** Logic App is designed to monitor and analyze suspicious sign-ins and credential activities detected by Microsoft Sentinel. It retrieves related IP addresses and checks their reputation using VirusTotal. It then analyzes sign-in activity using Azure Monitor logs and retrieves audit logs to confirm operations related to credential changes. Based on the results, it logs comments in Microsoft Sentinel and sends an email notification if any malicious activity is detected.
